SmallBrownDog's superb interpretation of a typical Commando Comic cover of the 
1960s - animated and given life!

Created with SBD's kind permission. I have taken SBD's two-dimensional image and 
have extracted the layers to create an animated desktop program/widget that has 
action and realistic sound effects all encapsulated within a comic book cover.

This widget was created I.T.S.O. (in the style of) a Commando Comic by DC Thompson. 
Neither I nor SBD have any association with DC Thompson and the Commando Logo 
was used here as an example of ‘fair-use’ in fan-art and as of course as mere-flattery.
This Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere around the desktop 
as you require.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide.

Running the widget using a javascript engine frees javascript from running only 
within the captivity of a browser, you will now be able to run these widgets on 
your Windows desktop as long as you have the correct widget engine installed.
